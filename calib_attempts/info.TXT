Directory and scripts used to test and make attempts in calibration and correction of gaze points to make L2CS 
script runner.py work better. Results are not predictable and not so significant most of the time, but can
affect and in some ways correct gaze vectors, however here are documented example done tests.

*calibration_test.py*  is script used to measure 9 gaze vectors predicted by l2CS while user
is looking at 9 points at the screen (top left, top middle, top right, left middle, screen center, right middle,
down left,down middle, down right), user clicks "enter" after looking at one point and the averaged gaze vector 
after 10 measures is saved, the thing is done 9 times and results are saved to calibration_data.txt

*show_cal_points.py* enables to visualize gaze points in 3d plot after and before corrections 
in this example it uses linear regression, but there are probably better ways.

*runner.py* is modified in the way that it can use calibration_data.txt and expected points values together
with linear regression(this can be change for sure for something better) to make some "calibration"
changes to every gaze vector showed live.

linear regression calibv2.png shows example before and after correction of the points and every possible point between them
that can be affected in the same way in runner.py
